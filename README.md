Weather Data Provisioning & Reporting System 

Excited to share my latest Data Engineering project under the guidance of Naseem Ahmad sir , where I applied industry-level ETL learnings from my work on the Unilever project to build a fully automated Weather Data Pipeline!

Tech Stack:
Apache Airflow | AWS S3 | PostgreSQL (Dbeaver) | Power BI | Python

Project Overview
Data Sources: Collected raw weather data from multiple APIs in JSON format.
Data Acquisition: Segregated and organized the data into five datasets, stored in S3 with weekly processing folders.
Transformation & Storing: Built a dynamic ETL pipeline transferring data from S3 → PostgreSQL using configuration-driven Python scripts.
Automation & Monitoring: Integrated Airflow for orchestration and Gmail alerts for error handling & job status updates.
Reporting: Created a real-time Power BI dashboard to visualize temperature, humidity, UV index, AQI, and forecast data.

Key Highlights
Applied ETL practices learned from the Unilever project to achieve an industry-grade workflow.
Fully automated end-to-end pipeline with modular design.
Real-time reporting with direct Postgres–Power BI connection.

This project strengthened my understanding of ETL development, data orchestration, and real-time analytics pipelines — bringing professional concepts into personal innovation.
