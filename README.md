# Weather_data_provisioning_-_reporting
Designed and implemented an end-to-end data engineering pipeline that collects, processes, and visualizes real-time weather data from multiple APIs. The project automates data acquisition, transformation, and reporting using a scalable and industry-grade ETL framework inspired by practices learned during the Unilever project.
